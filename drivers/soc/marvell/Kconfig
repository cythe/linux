config GTI_WATCHDOG
	tristate "GTI Watchdog driver"
	depends on ARM64
	help
	  GTI Watchdog driver, provides ioctl's for applications to
	  setup and enable the NMI Watchdog and also provides
	  an mmap() interface to map GTI device memory into process
	  address space for the application to directly poke the
	  GTI watchdog without any kernel support and entry.

config HW_CSR_ACCESS
	tristate "Access HW Device Config Space"
	default m
	help
	  provides an interface which enables user space utility to read from or to write
	  to HW Device Config Space Registers, Contexts, Memory.

config MARVELL_FWLOG
	tristate "firmware log interface"
	depends on ARM64
	help
	  Provides interface to read firmware boot logs. Firmware bootlogs are saved
	  in memory that is accessible from kernel. Enabling this option allows the
	  user to dump the firmware boot logs.

	  Firmware needs to build with `RECORD_FWLOG=1` to see the boot logs and
	  U-boot config `CONFIG_FWLOG_TTYMEM` is also required to have this feature
	  validated from linux.

	  Say Y here if you want to dump the firmware boot logs from linux shell. This
	  option is available only for Octeon10 and OcteonTX2 platforms.

config MVMDIO_UIO
	tristate "Marvell MDIO interface driver"
	  default m
	select MDIO_THUNDER
	help
	  Select this option if you want to provide an interface for userspace
	  PHY drivers to access Marvell's MDIO bus.

config MARVELL_CN10K_SERDES_DIAGNOSTICS
	tristate "Marvell SerDes diagnostics debugfs driver"
	default m
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable SerDes diagnostics
	  interface for performing PRBS, setting Loopback mode or
	  reading/writing Tx/Rx tuning parameters.

config MRVL_PHY_DIAGNOSTICS
	tristate "Marvell PHY diagnostics debugfs driver"
	default m
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Select this option if you want an additional interface for
	  extended diagnostics functions for the PHY. This complements
	  functionality offered by ethtool. Requires PHY driver support in ATF.

config OCTEONTX2_GHES_BERT
	bool "OcteonTX2 GHES Boot Error Record support"
	default y
	help
	  Select this option to enable reporting of fatal Marvell GHES
	  errors on subsequent Linux boot.  Normally, fatal errors will
	  reset the system.  Enabling support here will allow such errors
	  to be reported when Linux is started again.

config OCTEONTX2_EINJ
	tristate "OcteonTX2 ECC Injection"
	help
	  Provides support for error injection to OcteonTX2
	  memory controllers (LMC) and cache blocks.
	  This facilitates testing of the memory controller RAS features and
	  is intended to be used by test personnel when conducting system tests.
	  To compile this as a module, choose M here. The module will be
	  called otx2-einj.
	  Unless testing, say N here.

config MARVELL_CN10K_EINJ
	tristate "CN10K ECC Injection"
	help
	  Provides support for error injection to CN10K
	  Pseudo-fault Generation processor error,
	  dram memory subsystem (DSS).
	  This facilitates testing of the memory controller RAS features and
	  is intended to be used by test personnel when conducting system tests.
	  To compile this as a module, choose M here. The module will be
	  called cn10k-einj.
	  Unless testing, say N here.

config OCTEONTX_INFO
       tristate "OcteonTX Info driver"
	depends on PROC_FS
	help
	provides procfs interface to board information like board name, board revision
	mac addresses, board serial number and more. These are boards housing Marvell
	OcteonTX family chipsets.
