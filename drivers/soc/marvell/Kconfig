config MARVELL_FWLOG
	tristate "firmware log interface"
	depends on ARM64
	help
	  Provides interface to read firmware boot logs. Firmware bootlogs are saved
	  in memory that is accessible from kernel. Enabling this option allows the
	  user to dump the firmware boot logs.

	  Firmware needs to build with `RECORD_FWLOG=1` to see the boot logs and
	  U-boot config `CONFIG_FWLOG_TTYMEM` is also required to have this feature
	  validated from linux.

	  Say Y here if you want to dump the firmware boot logs from linux shell. This
	  option is available only for Octeon10 and OcteonTX2 platforms.
